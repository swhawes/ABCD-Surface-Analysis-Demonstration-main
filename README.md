# ABCD-Surface-Analysis-Demonstration

This repository serves as supplementary material to the "Longitudinal Analysis of the ABCDÂ® Study" which may be found at [https://longitudinal.dev/](https://longitudinal.dev/).

The repository contains jupyter notebooks displaying the results of a mass-univariate mixed effects analysis of 9835 fMRI surface images drawn from 5179 subjects across repeated visits. Raw data employed for analysis was taken from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ([ABCD](https://abcdstudy.org/)) study and results were generated using the Big Linear Mixed Model ([BLMM](https://github.com/TomMaullin/BLMM)) toolbox. For a full description of the files contained in this repository, please see the documentation in [`Demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/TomMaullin/ABCD-Surface-Analysis-Demonstration/blob/main/Demo.ipynb).
